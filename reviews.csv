ReadingMama,"Los perros y los gatos son las mascotas m√°s populares en todo el mundo. Algunas personas creen que los perros son nuestros mejores amigos. Otros creen que los gatos son las mascotas perfectas. Pero ambos son muy diferentes. Los gatos escuchan todo mientras los perros tienen mejor olfato. Los gatos escalofriantes pero los perros muy sociales. Los gatos mas dormil√≥n y m√°s limpios mientras los perros tiene major variedad de tama√±os y formas. Ambos son deportistas inteligentes y perfectos. Cuando un gato ser duerme en tus brazos o cuando un perro te da un beso baboso sabr√°s cual es la mascota perfecta para ti. Cualquiera que tenga~ Para mi no me gusta ninguna porque no tengo tiempo para cuidarse. Yo tengo dos hijas y ellas son suficientes.",4,April 26, 2021,904 reviews
Samarah,"Informational 1st-3rd First off I would like to start off by saying I love both cats and dogs. Therefore this argument is a hard one for me. However I loved the way the information is set up in this book. I love how there are simple challenges and facts that go with each and every chapter. I feel as though in the end a student would be able to decide which animal they like best in why. With this I would probably tie in fact or opinion into a lesson of some sort. All in all this book has a good number of usage.",5,November 29, 2021,163 reviews

Sailer Galusha-McRobbie,"Good book for middle elementary age students. The book is set up in a fun way with great pictures and informational facts about cats and dogs. Each chapter is a different \"challenge\" to see whether the dogs or the cats will win and it gives all kinds of good information and facts to back up the choice of which animal wins which challenge. The facts and different text boxes across the pages were so intriguing and fun I loved this book and I know students would too.",,April 19, 2020,55 reviews
Corinne Pettry,"\"Cats vs Dogs\" is an informational book about cats and dogs and it explains all the differences between the two common household pets. This book is very simple and easy to read with lots of interesting facts about everyones furry friends. I think this is a great book for young kids to read and learn some new vocabulary.

From what I was able to understand (which was still a fair amount) it was a very informative book that younger kids (who know Spanish) would have enjoyed a lot.

Christine.Newmanbetheluniversityedu,"Genre: Informational Text Grade: 1-3 I found this book very informative. It is full of helpful facts of which animal is better at a particular thing such as hearing or smelling. There is a cat dictionary and dog dictionary that I found cool as well especially for children that have not experienced having a cat or dog as a pet at home.
